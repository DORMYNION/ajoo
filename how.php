        <h1>How does it work ?</h1>

        <p>The Ajoo platform is a portal for people willing to come together to create and launch their Rotational Group Savings Scheme. Once a group of individuals decide to come together to form a rotational group savings scheme, the promoters will register the group on the Ajoo Platform, a group account will be created on the platform and a WhatsApp group will be created , a WhatsApp URL link will be generated for same. This link is then shared by the promoters of the group to the participants to enable them to join the group on WhatsApp.</p>


          <p>The platform is free for all participants, it serves as a vehicle for group members to interact and to allow other interested participants to join in.</p>


          <p>Anyone can choose to form a Rotational Group Savings Scheme on the Ajooplatform by initiating a group with a minimum of 4 members. The person who registers the Rotational Group Savings Scheme on the Ajoo Platform will be designated asthe group administrator in WhatsApp.</p>


          <p>The platform will list the directory of all available groups on the Ajoo Platform, this  makes it possible for people to request details of the group's  activities, rules and regulations and possibly apply to join the group , of course this will be totally dependent on the existing participants of such groups, if they are willing to admit anyone to their group.</p>


          <p>The minimum number of participants needed to form a group is 4, while the maximum is 10.</p>


          <p>Member participants in a rotational group savings scheme contribute a fixed amount as per agreed schedule (which could be weekly, bi-weekly or monthly). The accumulated funds arethen assigned to each member of the group in rotation, until all have benefited from the funds. As a result, each member is able to access a lump sum of money during the life of the association and use it for whatever purpose she or he desires.</p>
